.TH CLUE 1
.SH NAME
clue \-   request a clue locally, remotely or globally
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clue
[-frtv9GW] [user...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  clue
requests a clue for the local user (default) or for a remote user through the
Clue Request Broker /etc/clue/crb. Persistent clue requests are maintained in
/etc/cluetab and are executed by the clue daemon, started from
/etc/init.d/clued, at scheduled intervals defined in the cluetab file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-f
Force clue propagation. If the braind associated with the user's uid is in a
zombie state, this option sends a SIGHUP to the user's brain daemon and
requests a fresh clue.
.TP
.B \-r [domain...]
Recursively propagate across a subdomain or domain, such as
corporate.smike.com. Depending on the size of the domain and density of the
users, this option may take quite a while to complete. Note that certain
domains, particularly the .gov top-level domain, may invalidate clues faster
than they can be propagated.
.TP
.B \-t
Today. Request clue propagation as soon as possible.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose. Display the clue to the user's tty. A copy is written to
/var/adm/cluelog or the syslog server. Also redirects /opt/clue/derr.au to
/dev/audio.
.TP
.B \-9
Force a braind SIGHUP utilizing the STDBFH /dev/bighammer by calling
.I touch(1).
.TP
.B \-G [group...]
Group clue request. Issue a clue request to an entire group or organization.
May be used globally. Compatible with LDAP, NIS and NIS+.
.TP
.B \-W

seconds until a WTFack is received.
